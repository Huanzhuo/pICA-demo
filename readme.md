## Description

The demonstrator shows that our in-network computing-based pICA method can effectively address the challenges for transmission and computing latency of IIoT applications. By interacting with the demonstrator, the audience can better understand the concept of in-network computing and see how, together with the proposed audio data processing method, it can achieve the low-latency requirements of anomaly detection in smart factories.

## Run pICA demo

1. Open the URL of [pICA-demo](https://huanzhuo.github.io/pICA-demo/).
2. pICA and FastICA can be run, paused, and reloaded on-demand in the web application.
